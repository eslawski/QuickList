# QuickList
*a Reddit inspired TODO list mobile application for Android*

**User Guide**  
1) Add a new task with the "+" button (due date not supported yet)  
2) Give the task some upvotes, why not.  
3) Make more tasks!  
4) Sort the tasks to reorganize them by priority  
5) Close the app and comeback later to add more task or revaluate priorities. 
6) Swipe tasks away when you complete them!

**Background**  
I once thought that when I graduated college my TODO lists would finally shrink. I could not have been more wrong. Just having a full time job and trying to plan a wedding I have easily tripled my largest of TODO lists. Instead of post-its everywhere or a messy google doc of tasks, I decided to get my feet wet again with Android.

As you become an adult time becomes more precious. Bottom line, you don't have time to do everything you want to do. I find the same applies for TODO lists. You don't have time for everything, you need to pick the most important tasks to get done first. I noticed this when I started color coding my lists corresponding to their priority, and that made me think. This reminds me a lot of Reddit. Only seeing the tasks that really matter. I took the simple idea and ran with it knowing I would also learn a thing or two along the way.



Got too many tasks? Concerned about performance? Not to worry, I learned all about the RecyclerViewer. The RecyclerViewer renders content to the screen as you scroll. This way you are not bogged down by trying to bind all those views for EVERY task in your list. The android API also provides some great helper classes with callbacks for interacting with the RecyclerView. Check it out for yourself!

**Future Update Ideas**
- Implement the concept of a due date. Also allow for sorting of tasks by due date.
- Support multiple lists
- Enable list sharing to share tasks with friends/family
